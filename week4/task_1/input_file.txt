Data are collected using techniques such as measurement, observation, query, or analysis, and are typically represented 
as numbers or characters that may be further processed. Field data are data that are collected in an uncontrolled, in-situ
environment. Experimental data are data that are generated in the course of a controlled scientific experiment. Data are 
analyzed using techniques such as calculation, reasoning, discussion, presentation, visualization, or other forms of 
post-analysis. Prior to analysis, raw data (or unprocessed data) is typically cleaned: Outliers are removed, and obvious 
instrument or data entry errors are corrected.
